# Voltmeter
Voltmeter using an ATMEGA328P microcontroller and a seven-segment display.

 - This is one of my graduate school projects.
   
 - I used Microchip Studio to programing.

 - I developed a voltmeter using an ATMEGA328P microcontroller and a seven-segment display.

 - In this project, you can choose the channel you want to work with, the prescaler, and the reference voltage (VCC or 1.1 V).
